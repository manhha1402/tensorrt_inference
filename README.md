# TensorRT Inference

The repository provides a **C++/CUDA implementation** for performing deep learning model inference using **NVIDIA TensorRT**, a high-performance deep learning inference library. TensorRT is widely used to optimize and deploy models for NVIDIA GPUs, offering reduced latency and improved throughput compared to conventional frameworks.

## Key Features:
- **C++ Implementation**: Focuses on leveraging TensorRT through its C++ API for maximum performance and control.
- **Model Optimization**: Includes tools and code to load models, optimize them using TensorRT, and run them as highly efficient inference engines.
- **Precision Support**: Takes advantage of TensorRT's support for mixed precision (e.g., FP16 and INT8) to balance accuracy and speed.
- **Modularity**: The repository is designed to make it easy for users to integrate TensorRT inference into their C++ projects.

## Potential Use Cases:
- **Real-time AI Applications**: Ideal for use cases like object detection, classification, segmentation, or other inference tasks requiring minimal latency.
- **Deployment on NVIDIA GPUs**: For environments where TensorRT's optimizations can fully utilize the computational power of NVIDIA GPUs.
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: Deployment of inference pipelines in HPC environments.

## Prerequisites:
- **NVIDIA Hardware**: A compatible NVIDIA GPU is required to run TensorRT.
- **TensorRT SDK**: Properly installed TensorRT library and its C++ dependencies.
- **OpenCV**: The computer vision library.
- **CUDA Toolkit**: CUDA must be set up correctly on the system.
- **CMake**: For building the C++ project.
- **Deep Learning Knowledge**: Understanding of neural networks and familiarity with model conversion workflows.
